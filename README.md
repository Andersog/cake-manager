# Running the project

To run this project you must have installed

- Java
- Maven
- Node
- Angular CLI

Once these are installed, run the `run.bat` script within the source directory and the app will be available on http://localhost:8080

*note that some of the example images are no longer available, so I've included a file to read from instead.

Swagger available on http://localhost:8080/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html
